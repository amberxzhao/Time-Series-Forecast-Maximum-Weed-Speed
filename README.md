# Time-Series-Forecast-Maximum-Weed-Speed

The objective of this project was to study a time series model 
representative of maximum monthly wind speed in New York, and then to use 
this time series model to predict the maximum monthly wind speed. The data 
was collected monthly from January 2006 to December 2018, totally 156 
analytical observations. This time series generated by seasonal auto regressive 
integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to predict the maximum 
monthly wind speed of 2019.
