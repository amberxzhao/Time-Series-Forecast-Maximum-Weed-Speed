# Time Series Forecast
## Maximum Wind Speed in Central New York:<br /> Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Modeling <br />	

The objective of this project was to study a time series model 
representative of maximum monthly wind speed in New York, and then to use 
this time series model to predict the maximum monthly wind speed. 
  The data was collected monthly from January 2006 to December 2018, totally 156 
analytical observations. This time series generated by seasonal auto regressive 
integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to predict the maximum 
monthly wind speed of 2019. 

•	Identified the research interests and analysis objective, and collected raw data from online open data source <br />
•	Conducted data preparation for further analysis, including data cleaning and data property exploration (character, stationarity, decomposition) <br />
•	Applied the concepts and techniques of data mining on large data sets of an original topic <br />
•	Built seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average model via R <br />
•	Generated modeling analysis and prediction results into a comprehensive research report <br />
